# mtp-thesis

This repo contains some of the codes that I used for my mtp-thesis titled "Medical Textual Question Answering System". The problems I worked/addressed are:
● Improving the accuracy of the classification model to classify the disease class of medical queries
● Retrieval of the top k significant and credible answers
● Detection of entities into two categories: drugs and diseases/symptoms

I have created a new database and used various ML and DL models along with transformer architectures like BERT, BART, etc to achieve the desired outcome. I have also written codes to parse websites to collect data and code to analyze the data. You can find out more about it by going through my thesis (also uploaded in the repo).
You can find other codes on my Google Colab.
